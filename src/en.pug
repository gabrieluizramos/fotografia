                            p.text I fell in love for photography around 2013, influenced by a friend. Since then, I've been dedicating my time to perfecting and improve not only my photographic vision, but the whole stetic around my work and also the way I capture moment through my lenses.

                            p.text From every niche we can imagine, concert photography always had my heart. Despite the fact I've dedicated myself to the music for a long time, being able to capture unique moments while artists are performing on stage was always something challenging and extremely motivating.

                            p.text To feel the energy that echoes in the delivery of an artists to its audience on stage and sublimating these moments in something concrete, palpable and visual is a unique experience that's even hard to describe.

                            p.text That's the thing that fascinates me: combining in a single artifact two artistic expressions, the art of photography and the art of music. In this journey on the stages I've had the honor to work and had my photos used by many press outlets, bands and producers. Hope you'll enjoy my work!

                    p.text Since it started out as a hobby, for many years I've shot with smartphones.

                    p.text Although it might seem a bit limited for anyone reading it for the first time, we all know that who takes a good photo is who's behind the lens, not the equipment. After so long photographing with fixed lenses, I turned out to notice everiday situations in a different perspective, and that's how one of my simplest photos, taken with a phone, used to have my biggest view/download rate on Unsplash (<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/MqnJttIdHGQ" target="_blank">photo</a>), with almost 3M views today.

                    p.text With that, I have a little challenge for you. Can you find out which photos in my portfolio were done with a smartphone? Let me know!

                    p.text Although photographing concerts is what really moves me, capturing everyday situations is something easy to do on a daily basis. I always bring my camera when I'm out for a walk on somewhere new.

                    p.text Photographing by passion allows me to try new different niches, including random ones like game photography (you can see it in my <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/gabrieluizramos/" target="_blank">Flickr</a>), nature and animals.
